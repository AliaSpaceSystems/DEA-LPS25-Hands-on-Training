<div style="text-align: justify">
<b>This hands-on training will guide participants through the creation of impactful stories using <a href="https://dea.destine.eu/web">DEA</a>, a Data Visualization and Interactive Storytelling Service.</b>
DEA supports users in presenting environmental and climate information in a clear and engaging way.
<br><br>
The session will introduce DEA, its role within Earth Observation and Climate Change initiatives, and the <b>portfolio of ready-to-use datasets</b> it offers, including climate projections, reanalysis datasets like ERA5, and real-time forecasts data from ECMWF and Copernicus services.
<br><br>
Participants will also learn how to enrich their stories by adding external content from researches, local studies, or custom analyses. The presenter will demonstrate <b>how to prepare and process external content</b> — such as maps, charts, or videos generated from satellite-based data or socio-economic statistics — using complementary tools and how to integrate these elements into DEA to enhance the final narrative.
<br><br>
The core of the training will focus on hands-on story creation, where participants will practice step-by-step:<br><br>
- <b>Selecting relevant datasets and defining the narrative angle</b>.<br>
- <b>Creating maps, graphs, and media-rich visualisations</b>.<br>
- <b>Combining data-driven content with textual annotations</b>.

<br><br>
By the end of the session, attendees will understand <b>how DEA can be used to present scientific results, support decision-making processes, show effects of extreme events and explain environmental challenges at different scales, from global strategies to local adaptation plans.</b> They will leave with practical skills to use the DEA service and turn their own data and findings into compelling, interactive stories.
